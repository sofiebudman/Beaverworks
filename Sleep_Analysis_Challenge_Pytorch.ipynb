        "Every year, the [PhysioNet/CinC (Computing in Cardiology) Challenge](https://www.physionet.org/challenge/) invites \"participants to tackle clinically interesting problems that are either unsolved or not well-solved.\" For this year's week 2 machine learning challenge, BWSI has revived a past PhysioNet challenge based on sleep classification.\n",
        "\n",
        "This year's challenge focuses on the classification of nonarousal and arousal timeframes. If you would like to understand the biological implications of the challenge, we recommend reading PhysioNet's [introduction](https://physionet.org/challenge/2018/) of the challenge.\n",
        "\n",
        "For this challenge, you will classify samples into 5 classes (Arousal, NREM1, NREM2, NREM3, REM). Each sample consists of seven physiological signals (O2-M1, E1-M2, Chin1-Chin2, ABD, CHEST, AIRFLOW, ECG) measured at 200 Hz over a 60 second period (12000 timepoints). In this notebook, we provide code to import the data, visualize sample signals, implement an example classifier, and 'score' your model."

The area under the curve (AUC) measures discrimination, the classifier's ability to correctly identify samples from the \"positive\" and \"negative\" cases. Intuitively, AUC is the probability that a randomly chosen \"positive\" sample will be labeled as \"more positive\" than a randomly chosen \"negative\" sample. In the case of a multi-class ROC curve, each class is considered separately before taking the weighted average of all the class results. Simply put, the class under consideration is labeled as \"positive\" while all other classes are labeled as \"negative.\" Below is the multi-class ROC curve for the example classifier. The AUCROC score should be between 0 and 1, in which 0.5 is random classification and 1 is perfect classification.\n",
